Created a mini test framework with one test that will launch any ecommerce site: https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/

1 - Launch website
2 - Add any item to the cart
3 - Verify the correct item has been added to the cart (EXAMPLE: If you added a Samsung Fridge to the cart, you will need to verify that the correct Samsung Fridge was added to the cart)
