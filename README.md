# Ecommerce Site Test Framework

## Description:
This mini test framework is designed to automate the testing of an ecommerce website. The framework includes a test case that launches the website, adds an item to the cart, and verifies that the correct item has been added.

## Test Case:
- **Launch Website, Add Item to Cart, Verify Correct Item:**
    1. Launch the ecommerce website [magento software testing board](https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/).
    2. Add any item to the cart.
    3. Verify that the correct item has been added to the cart.

## Example:
Upon running the test framework, it will automate the steps mentioned in the test case. For instance, if you add a "Samsung Fridge" to the cart, the framework will verify that the correct "Samsung Fridge" has been added to the cart.
